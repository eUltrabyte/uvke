#### uvke ( Ultrabyte Vulkan Engine ) is open source vulkan based rendering ( and maybe game ) engine written in C++20.
##### It's Hukan deputy but prepared for 2d and more flexible.

### Libraries
[glfw](https://github.com/glfw/glfw) - Open source, multi-platform library for OpenGL, OpenGL ES and Vulkan application development. It provides a simple, platform-independent API for creating windows, contexts and surfaces, reading input, handling events, etc.

[Vulkan SDK](https://lunarg.com/vulkan-sdk/) - Vulkan is a new generation graphics and compute API that provides high-efficiency, cross-platform access to modern graphics processing units, which are used in a wide variety of devices from PCs and consoles to mobile phones and embedded platforms.

[stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h) - Image loading/decoding from file/memory: JPG, PNG, TGA, BMP, PSD, GIF, HDR, PIC.

[imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) - Bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++. It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline-enabled application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic, and self-contained (no external dependencies).
